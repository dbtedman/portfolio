## Business Need

Griffith needed a tool to assist in the creation of course learning outcomes that supported collaboration between academics within the institution.

## Our Solution

A Laravel based web application that provides features such as SSO integration and collaboration between different academics. Data is stored in an Oracle database.

## My Contribution

As a web application developer, my focus was on the Laravel and Oracle DB components but have also assisted with all aspects of the systemâ€™s development.
