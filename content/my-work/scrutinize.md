CLI tool for developers to scrutinize web application information architectures.

2020 - Now

[github.com/dbtedman/scrutinize](https://github.com/dbtedman/scrutinize)

## Community Need

Understanding the information architecture of web applications is complex and time consuming. Usually this process involves manually tracing links in a spreadsheet, but there this is something that automation can assist with.

## Our Solution

A golang based command line interface that allows a developer too quickly and accurately map the structure of a web application to understand how it fits together.

## My Contribution

As the primary developer on this project, I have contributed to all aspects of the development and planning activities.
