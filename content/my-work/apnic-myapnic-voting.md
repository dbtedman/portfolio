Voting platform used to facilitate APNIC elections.

**2019 - 2021**

[my.apnic.net/voting](https://my.apnic.net/voting)

## Business Need

APNIC is required to conduct regular elections to appoint its [executive council](https://www.apnic.net/community/participate/elections/ec/). During previous elections, a combination of paper and digital ballots was used, however as part of a larger digital transformation, voting needed to go fully online.

## Our Solution

The best platform for implementing a voting solution is our recently released MyAPNIC Dashboard. This platform provided the foundational elements necessary to integrate with an external voting system to manage the casting of votes, along with APNIC Login facilities ensure secure voting. Our voting system was accessible and mobile responsive to best serve the wide range of community members that interact with the platform.

## My Contribution

I implemented an extension to our WordPress based MyAPNIC Dashboard, with API interaction with our third party vote casting platform and MyAPNIC Resource Manager for determining for account status information.
