Website to connect Griffith MBA to the wider community.

**2012 - 2013**

## Business Need

Griffith MBA school had an initiative to expand their interconnection with the wider business community and for prospective MBA students.

## Our Solution

A cross platform web application which was delivered to mobile platforms via phone gap software. An admin system provides dynamic data to the client application. This data was maintained by members of the MBA school.

## My Contribution

As a front-end developer, my focus was on implementing the client application and integrating with the back-end administration system.
