## Business Need

Griffith needed a platform for sharing Learning and Teaching practices, technologies and strategies to help different parts of the organization to better collaborate together and for Griffith to share with the wider educational community.

## Our Solution

A custom web application build in the Symfony framework, sourcing data from an Oracle database.

## My Contribution

As a web application developer, my focus was on the back-end of the application but I assisted with all aspects of the applications development.
