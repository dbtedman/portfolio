A demonstration project showing how WordPress can be used as an API backend to a Single Page Application (SPA) frontend.

**2020**

## Community Need

WordPress is used all around the web, but it can be difficult to create interactive applications due to its focus on server rendering. Meanwhile, single page application frameworks like Vue and React have become mainstream but are difficult to implement with WordPress.

## Our Solution

A combination of a Vue SPA and WordPress as a BFF, implemented in a manner where only a single domain and port mapping is required.

## My Contribution

As the primary developer for the project, I have contributed to all aspects of its development.
