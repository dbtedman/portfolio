A platform to facilitate the delivery of a 100% online conference.

**2020**

## Business Need

Previous to APNIC 50, APNIC delivered an in person conference which was supplemented by a website for registration and session information. Due to recent global circumstances, a 100% online conference was a necessity.

## Our Solution

With limited time to implement a 100% online conference platform, our solution involved leveraging the existing conference website, whilst adding integrations with our SSO infrastructure and Zoom Webinar API.

## My Contribution

As a full stack web developer, my contribution was primarily focused on assisting in the implementing of the Zoom Webinars and SSO integrations.
