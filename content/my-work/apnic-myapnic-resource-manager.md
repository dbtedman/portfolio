Platform for APNIC members to maintain resource allocations and membership accounts.

**2019 - NOW**

[resources.apnic.net](https://resources.apnic.net/)

## Business Need

APNIC needs a platform for its members to maintain their resource allocations and membership accounts.

## Our Solution

A legacy Perl application, that APNIC has been maintaining for many years, is fronted by a Java facade that is progressively taking over control of application features as we improve parts of the overall application.

## My Contribution

As a Full Stack Web Developer, I have participated in the maintenance of this project, and small feature improvements.
