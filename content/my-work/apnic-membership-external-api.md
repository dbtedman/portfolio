External API to provide membership data to APNIC developed client applications.

**2020 - NOW**

## Business Need

APNIC needed an API that is available from outside of the APNIC network for use in client applications to provide membership data.

## Our Solution

A Java Spring API that authenticates via OpenId Connect Tokens to provide access to internal APNIC services.

## My Contribution

As a Senior Full Stack Web Developer, I have contributed to all aspects of the APIs development.
