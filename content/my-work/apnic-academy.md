Online educational platform for learning internet technologies.

**2018 - 2020**

[academy.apnic.net](https://academy.apnic.net/)

## Business Need

APNIC needed to expand their training from primarily in person to a mixture of in person and online. As part of this
transition, they wanted to leverage the benefits provided by asynchronous online learning. To achieve this goal, a new
platform needed to be developed.

## Our Solution

WordPress provided a learning management solution called LearnDash. As this system was chosen to host the educational
content, our system would be implemented as an extension to WordPress. The primary integrations developed for this
system were Zoom Webinars, Labs on Demand Virtual Labs and translations of educational materials into seven languages
that represent some of APNICâ€™s members.

## My Contribution

As the primary developer on this project, I have contributed to all aspects of the development and planning activities.
