## Community Need

Griffith needed the ability to integrate their Laravel applications with a custom implementation of SSO.

## Our Solution

A simple Composer plugin was implemented to connect between Laravel’s builtin authentication mechanisms and Griffith’s custom SSO implementation.

## My Contribution

As the only developer of this plugin, I was responsible for all aspects of its development.
