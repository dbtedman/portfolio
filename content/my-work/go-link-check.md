Link check automation tool.

**2019 - 2020**

## Community Need

Automated testing of link statuses to search for broken links usually is not build in a manner that fits with how developers work. A solution which takes into account developer practices such as CI/CD Pipelines and IDE Plugins would provide more useful testing of under development applications.

## Our Solution

A Go application that can run as a CLI, an API, and can run in a Docker image provides the flexibility needed to support all of the desired use cases.

## My Contribution

As the primary developer on this project, I have contributed to all aspects of the development and planning activities.
