Tool used for populating ExLNT link check report with validation statuses.

**2019 - 2020**

## Community Need

A gap in the websites link testing functionality existed where the platform was unable to perform its own link testing due to connectivity limitations so the list of links to test was extracted into a spreadsheet. A tool was then needed to execute the link tests.

## Our Solution

From the source of a spreadsheet, our solution performs HTTP requests and reviews the response behavior and writes this to an output report.

## My Contribution

As the primary developer for the tool, I have participated in all aspects of its development.
