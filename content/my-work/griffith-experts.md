A guide to Griffith University's academic and research expertise.

**2014 - 2016**

## Business Need

Griffith needed a way to better share the achievements of its academic and research groups through a web based platform.

## Our Solution

Griffith Experts was built on a customized version of the VIVO platform, a Java based system sourcing data from RDF data sources. As part of this platform, we build ETL systems to combine data from all of Griffithâ€™s different data sources in to the VIVO platform.

## My Contribution

Initially I worked as a front-end developer but transitioned to looking after all aspects of the platforms development.
