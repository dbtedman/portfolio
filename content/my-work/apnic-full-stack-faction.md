A cross-disciplinary guild that allows Full Stack Web Developers at APNIC to share knowledge and practice outside of their regular product teams.

## My Contribution

As a Senior Full Stack Web Developer, I initiated this guild, including establishing shared communication methods, documentation, and regular meetings.
